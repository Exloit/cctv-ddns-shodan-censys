Shodan queries for finding camera/IPcam/CCTV/DVR/NVR/VSS systems
http://firmware.re/vulns
https://github.com/zveriu/cctv-ddns-shodan-censys

My latest estimates are 1M+ systems/IP being returned by these queries. 

The systems found using these queries are most likely used in projects like:

*** Description ***

cctv_online_shodan.txt
    List of queries to be used with Shodan to locate online 
    camera/IPcam/CCTV/DVR/NVR/VSS systems.
    My latest estimates are 1M+ systems/IP being returned by these queries. 
    Preferably to be used via API, e.g.,:
    https://github.com/achillean/shodan-python
    
cctv_online_censys.txt
    List of queries to be used with Censys to locate online 
    camera/IPcam/CCTV/DVR/NVR/VSS systems.


cctv_ddns_docs.txt
    List of PDF guides documenting the use and configuration of DDNS for 
    CCTV systems.


cctv_ddns_services.txt
    List of DDNS services that are intended/advertised particularly for 
    CCTV systems. NOTE: this does not prevent these DDNS to host systems/pages 
    that are totally unrelated to CCTV.

    This list ideally would be used as input for TLDR (TLD records) project:
    https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/TLDR


generic_ddns_services.txt
    List of DDNS services that are generic, and can host CCTV systems as well.

    This list ideally would be used as input for TLDR (TLD records) project:
    https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/TLDR
